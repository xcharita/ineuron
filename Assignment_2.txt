1. What are the Boolean data type's two values? How do you go about writing them?True and False2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?AND, OR, NOT3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).A OR BA AND BNOT B0 OR 0 = 0 0 AND 0 = 0NOT 0 = 11 OR 0 = 11 AND 0 = 0NOT 1 = 00 OR 1 = 10 AND 1 = 01 OR 1 = 11 AND 1 = 14. What are the values of the following expressions?(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) : falsenot (5 > 4): false(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) : truenot ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) : false(True and True) and (True == False) : false(not False) or (not True): true5. What are the six different types of reference operators?i don’t know what you are aiming for6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?equal to ‘==’ , assignment ‘=’7. Describe a condition and when you would use one.‘==’  is used when you would like to find a boolean ‘=’  is used when you would like to assign a value to a variable8. Recognize the following three blocks in this code:spam = 0if spam == 10:    print('eggs')    if spam > 5:        print('bacon')    else:        print('ham')    print('spam')print('spam')9. Create a programme that prints. If 1 is stored in spam, prints Hello; if 2 is stored in spam, prints Howdy; and if 3 is stored in spam, prints Salutations! if there's something else in spam.if spam == 1:	print(‘Hello’)elif spam == 2:	print(‘Howdy’)elif spam==3:	print(‘Salutations’else:	print(‘spam’)10.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys can you press?^ + c (control + c)11. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?‘break’ just stops abrubtly and continues to the next statement outside the loop , and ‘continue’  will go to the next step within the loop12. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?range(10) : the loop will start with 0 and continues till 10-1range(0, 10): the loop will start with 0 and continues till 10-1range(0, 10, 1): the loop will start with 0 and continues till 10-1 in increments of 113. Using a for loop, write a short programme that prints the numbers 1 to 10 Then, using a while loop, create an identical programme that prints the numbers 1 to 10.for i in range(1,10+1):	print(i)i=1while i <=10	print(i)	i +=114. If you had a bacon() function within a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?b = bacon()
